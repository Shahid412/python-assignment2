I. Build a program that reads an integer over 100 from the user and displays all of the positive multiples of 7 up to (and including) the value entered by the user. 
Tip: you can use the range function to build a list of numbers. 

II. In the UK we have four seasons throughout the year: spring, summer, fall and winter. For 2021, the first day of seasons
Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. 
The user will enter the name of the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an integer. 
Then your program should display the season associated with the date that was entered.

III. A prime number is an integer greater than one that is only divisible by one and itself. 
Write a function that determines whether or not its parameter is prime, returning True if it is, and False otherwise. 
Write a main program that reads an integer from the user and displays a message indicating whether or not it is prime. 

IV. Saturday nights changed forever when Lotto was introduced back in 1994. 
Since then, it’s become the nation’s favourite game – played by millions in towns and cities across the country. 
In order to win the top prize in the National Lottery’s lotto, one must match all 6 numbers of a ticket to the 6 numbers between 1 and 59 that are drawn by the lottery organizer. 
Write a program that generates a random selection of 6 numbers for a lottery ticket. Ensure that the 6 numbers selected do not contain any duplicates. 
Finally, display the 6 different numbers in ascending order. 

V. After a catastrophe that left several injured visitors, an amusement park that exhibits genetically engineered prehistoric creatures is determined to entice people back in by temporarily lowering the price of admission based on the age of the guest. 
Guests 3 years of age and less are admitted without charge. Children between 4 and 11 years of age cost £899.90. Seniors over 69 years and over cost £1490.49. Admission for all other guests is £1999.99
Craft a program that begins by reading the ages of all of the guests in a group from the user, with one age entered on each line. 
The user will enter a blank line to indicate that there are no more guests in the group. 
Then your program should display the admission cost for the group with an appropriate message. 
The cost should be displayed using two decimal places. 
Tip: The park aims to introduce a new “asset” that is sure to increase the number of visitors. 
To offset the expense in developing new genetic modification techniques, the entry prices will increase in the future. 
Babies will probably be charged for entry then. Make your program easy to update, planning for this future change in pricing
